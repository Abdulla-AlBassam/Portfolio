# Portfolio Progress Log

## 2026-02-13

### Projects Page — Index & New Cards

- Renamed sidebar heading from "CYBERSECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT INDEX" to just "INDEX"
- Added "In Progress" filter category (italicised) — positioned below "All" and above "Cybersecurity"
- Added "Machine Learning" filter category to the sidebar index
- Added two new in-progress project cards:
  1. **Sweaty: Social Game Diary & Discovery Platform** — tagged under Development + In Progress. React Native (Expo), TypeScript, Supabase, Next.js.
  2. **Secure Local Mail System with ML-Based Spam Detection Under Adversarial Conditions** — tagged under Machine Learning + In Progress. DistilBERT, TF-IDF, SMTP, Adversarial ML.

### Still TODO

- Replace placeholder images for new cards (`/projects/11.jpg`, `/projects/12.jpg`)
- Replace placeholder links (`TODO_LINK_11`, `TODO_LINK_12`) with real URLs
- All earlier cards (`TODO_LINK_01` through `TODO_LINK_10`) also still need real links and images
