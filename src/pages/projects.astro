              Designed and delivered a qualitative usable-security study on young
              adults' password hygiene and safeguard adoption, using
              semi-structured interviews, ethics-aware data handling, and rigorous
              literature synthesis to extract actionable security UX insights.

              I interviewed young adults to understand how they actually handle
              passwords and online safety, then turned the patterns into practical
              recommendations.

              Engineered an object-oriented PHP REST API (front-controller
              routing, clean URLs, JSON-first responses) backed by SQLite, with
              API-key header auth, input sanitisation, robust error handling, and
              documented endpoints (search + pagination + CRUD where required).
              Then produced a future-proof architecture spec for scaling to
              multiple conferences with per-conference DB isolation, admin
              workflows, user accounts, personal notes, schedule support, and
              engagement analytics (4+1 views).

              Conducted an end-to-end DFIR investigation across a RAM dump and
              HDD image, correlating volatile artefacts with persistent evidence
              to rebuild user activity, intent, and a defensible timeline;
              produced an investigative report with structured evidence tagging

              and validation via show/ping/traceroute evidence. Extended the work

            <p class="technical">
              Designed and implemented an enterprise WAN in GNS3 using MPLS VPN
              segmentation (P/PE model with OSPF in the core and VRF-based
              isolation), plus selective IPSec protection for sensitive traffic
              only (balancing security vs performance). Added access-control
              constraints between departments, justified SQL service placement
              using performance modelling, and delivered structured implementation
              + verification evidence (show/ping/traceroute/crypto

            <p class="technical">
              Built an OS-focused C implementation demonstrating process creation,
              POSIX threading, scheduling behaviour, and safe synchronisation
              (mutex + semaphore) in a producer/consumer style workflow. Then
              designed a replicated DNS setup with BIND9 and delivered a secure,
              load-balanced Apache web service architecture suitable for high
              availability, including integration of DNS records to route traffic

              Planned and executed a structured penetration test against a

              testing with request interception/manipulation to validate
              exploitability. Produced a professional pentest-style write-up with
